CI/CD pipelines need clear instructions on the build, test, and deployment processes, along with troubleshooting steps for failures.\n\nIncident response and monitoring should have detailed runbooks, alerting systems, and rollback procedures.

Covers scope, hoisting, reassignment, redeclaration, and common pitfalls with examples.","2025-08-24",[19,88,89],"ES6","Basics","Choosing between const, let, and var impacts how predictable and safe your code is. Here’s a quick guide with examples.\r\n\r\n## TL;DR rules\r\n\r\n- Use const by default. It prevents accidental reassignment.\r\n- Use let only when you must reassign (counters, state updates, loops).\r\n- Avoid var. It’s function-scoped, hoisted differently, and can cause subtle bugs.\r\n\r\n## Scope differences\r\n\r\n- var → function-scoped (or global if declared at top level)\r\n- let/const → block-scoped ({}), safer in loops and conditionals\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction demo() {\r\n  if (true) {\r\n    var a = 1;     // function-scoped\r\n    let b = 2;     // block-scoped\r\n    const c = 3;   // block-scoped\r\n  }\r\n  console.log(a); // 1\r\n  // console.log(b); // ReferenceError\r\n  // console.log(c); // ReferenceError\r\n}\r\ndemo();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Hoisting and the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)\r\n\r\n- var is hoisted and initialized to undefined.\r\n- let/const are hoisted but uninitialized until the declaration line (TDZ). Accessing before that throws a ReferenceError.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(a); // undefined (var is hoisted)\r\n// console.log(b); // ReferenceError (TDZ)\r\n// console.log(c); // ReferenceError (TDZ)\r\nvar a = 1;\r\nlet b = 2;\r\nconst c = 3;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Reassignment and redeclaration\r\n\r\n- const: no reassignment; object contents can still be mutated.\r\n- let: can reassign; cannot redeclare in the same scope.\r\n- var: can reassign and redeclare (another reason to avoid).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst person = { name: \"Ada\" };\r\n// person = {}; // ❌ TypeError (no reassignment)\r\nperson.name = \"Lovelace\"; // ✅ allowed (mutation)\r\n\r\nlet count = 0;\r\ncount = 1; // ✅ reassignment allowed\r\n// let count = 2; // ❌ SyntaxError (redeclaration in same scope)\r\n\r\nvar x = 1;\r\nvar x = 2; // ✅ redeclaration allowed (can hide bugs)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Loops: why let/const shine\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Using var leaks the index outside the loop and shares one binding across iterations\r\nfor (var i = 0; i \u003C 3; i++) {\r\n  setTimeout(() => console.log(\"var i:\", i), 0);\r\n}\r\n// → prints 3, 3, 3\r\n\r\n// Using let creates a new binding each iteration (expected values)\r\nfor (let j = 0; j \u003C 3; j++) {\r\n  setTimeout(() => console.log(\"let j:\", j), 0);\r\n}\r\n// → prints 0, 1, 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Practical guidelines\r\n\r\n- Prefer const for values that shouldn’t change (config, imported data, functions).\r\n- Use let for counters, accumulators, or state that changes over time.\r\n- Don’t use var in modern codebases.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nUse const by default, let when you must reassign, and avoid var.

Here are concise, high-signal Q&As with code you can skim and practice.\r\n\r\n## 1) Props vs State\r\n\r\n- Props: external, read-only inputs to a component.\r\n- State: internal, mutable via setState/useState.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction Greeting({ name }) { // props\r\n  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0); // state\r\n  return (\r\n    \u003Cdiv>\r\n      \u003Cp>Hello {name}\u003C/p>\r\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>{count}\u003C/button>\r\n    \u003C/div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2) Why are keys needed in lists?\r\n\r\nKeys help React identify which items changed, added, or removed for efficient reconciliation. Use stable, unique IDs—not indexes—when order can change.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nitems.map(item => \u003CItem key={item.id} {...item} />);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3) useEffect basics (deps and cleanup)\r\n\r\nRun side effects after render; declare dependencies precisely. Cleanup runs before the next effect or on unmount.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  const id = setInterval(fetchData, 5000);\r\n  return () => clearInterval(id); // cleanup\r\n}, [fetchData]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4) useMemo vs useCallback\r\n\r\n- useMemo caches a computed value.\r\n- useCallback caches a function reference.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst total = useMemo(() => sum(list), [list]);\r\nconst onAdd = useCallback((x) => setList(l => [...l, x]), []);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 5) Controlled vs Uncontrolled components\r\n\r\n- Controlled: value driven by state; single source of truth.\r\n- Uncontrolled: DOM holds state; access via refs.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n// Controlled\r\nconst [value, setValue] = useState(\"\");\r\n\u003Cinput value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />\r\n\r\n// Uncontrolled\r\nconst ref = useRef();\r\n\u003Cinput ref={ref} defaultValue=\"hi\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 6) Preventing unnecessary re-renders\r\n\r\nUse React.memo for pure components, useCallback/useMemo to stabilize props, and avoid creating new objects inline unless needed.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst Child = React.memo(function Child({ onClick }) { /* ... */ });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 7) Lifting state up\r\n\r\nWhen two siblings need shared data, move state to their closest common ancestor and pass it down via props.\r\n\r\n## 8) Context vs Redux\r\n\r\nContext: lightweight prop drilling escape hatch. Redux/RTK: state management for complex apps (middleware, devtools, caching with RTK Query).\r\n\r\n## 9) Error boundaries\r\n\r\nClass components catching render/commit errors below them; use libraries (e.g., react-error-boundary) for hooks ergonomics.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nclass Boundary extends React.Component {\r\n  state = { hasError: false };\r\n  static getDerivedStateFromError() { return { hasError: true }; }\r\n  componentDidCatch(err, info) { /* log */ }\r\n  render() { return this.state.hasError ? \u003CFallback/> : this.props.children; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 10) Lazy, Suspense, and code-splitting\r\n\r\nSplit bundles and suspense while loading.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst Settings = React.lazy(() => import('./Settings'));\r\n\u003CReact.Suspense fallback={\u003CSpinner/>}>\r\n  \u003CSettings />\r\n\u003C/React.Suspense>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 11) useRef use cases\r\n\r\nPersist values across renders without causing re-renders (DOM nodes, timers, instance vars).\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst idRef = useRef(null);\r\nuseEffect(() => { idRef.current = setInterval(tick, 1000); return () => clearInterval(idRef.current); }, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 12) useReducer vs useState\r\n\r\nPrefer useReducer for multi-field or complex transitions; co-locate logic and state updates.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\r\n  switch (action.type) {\r\n    case 'inc': return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };\r\n    case 'reset': return { count: 0 };\r\n    default: return state;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nconst [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 13) Derived state pitfalls\r\n\r\nDon’t copy props to state unless you have a specific reason; derive on render or memoize.\r\n\r\n## 14) React 18: automatic batching\r\n\r\nMultiple state updates inside async callbacks batch by default, reducing extra renders.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nonClick={async () => {\r\n  setA(1); setB(2); // batched\r\n}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 15) Performance checklist\r\n\r\n- Normalize data; avoid deep prop chains.\r\n- Memoize expensive calculations and stable callbacks.\r\n- Virtualize long lists (react-window, react-virtualized).\r\n- Defer non-critical work (idle callbacks, Suspense streaming on server).","src/data/blog/post5.md","e0a40828e80ca0eb",{"html":135,"metadata":136},"\u003Cp>Preparing for a React interview?

Here’s a concise guide to SSR vs CSR.\r\n\r\n## What is CSR (Client-Side Rendering)?\r\n\r\nThe server sends a minimal HTML shell and a JavaScript bundle. The browser downloads JS, builds the UI, and fetches data. First paint can be fast, but content may be blank until hydration completes.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Great for rich, highly interactive apps\r\n- Can cache static assets on CDN\r\n- Simple hosting (static + API)\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Slower Time to First Byte (TTFB) and First Contentful Paint (FCP)\r\n- SEO depends on prerendering/bot support\r\n- Heavier JS on the client\r\n\r\nCSR example (React):\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction Products() {\r\n  const [items, setItems] = React.useState([]);\r\n  React.useEffect(() => {\r\n    fetch('/api/products').then(r => r.json()).then(setItems);\r\n  }, []);\r\n  return items.map(p => \u003Cdiv key={p.id}>{p.name}\u003C/div>);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What is SSR (Server-Side Rendering)?\r\n\r\nHTML is rendered on the server per request (or edge) and sent to the browser. Users see content earlier; hydration attaches interactivity on the client.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Better FCP/LCP and perceived performance\r\n- SEO-friendly out of the box\r\n- Personalized content at request time\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Higher server cost/complexity\r\n- Longer TTFB if server/data is slow\r\n- Still ships client JS for interactivity\r\n\r\nSSR example (Next.js):\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n// pages/products.js (Next 12/13 pages router)\r\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\r\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/products');\r\n  const items = await res.json();\r\n  return { props: { items } };\r\n}\r\nexport default function Page({ items }) {\r\n  return items.map(p => \u003Cdiv key={p.id}>{p.name}\u003C/div>);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Performance and SEO\r\n\r\n- CSR: use code-splitting, lazy, and route-based bundles; prefetch data and cache aggressively.\r\n- SSR: stream HTML, cache at the edge, and avoid slow blocking calls. Hydrate only what’s interactive.\r\n\r\nKey metrics: TTFB (server), FCP/LCP (paint), TTI (hydration/JS), CLS (layout stability).\r\n\r\n## When to choose which?\r\n\r\n- Choose CSR when: app is SPA-like, authentication heavy, and SEO is limited or handled via prerendering.\r\n- Choose SSR when: SEO matters, content must be visible fast, or you need per-request personalization.\r\n\r\n## Hybrids and modern options\r\n\r\n- SSG/ISR: pre-render at build time and revalidate for scale.\r\n- Islands/Partial Hydration (Astro): render most HTML on server, hydrate only interactive islands—great DX and performance.\r\n- Edge SSR/Streaming: reduce latency and show content progressively.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all. Use SSR for content-first and SEO; use CSR for app-first interactivity. Many stacks mix both for the best user experience.","src/data/blog/post6.md","7c3b5499373a19b2",{"html":202,"metadata":203},"\u003Cp>Understanding rendering strategies helps you deliver fast, SEO-friendly, and maintainable web apps.
